TMSwitch is a tool to automatically switch Time Machine volumes.

It keeps a list of volume UUIDS which are used as Time Machine volumes. These can be set using the TMSwitch add and TMSwitch remove commands.

When invoked, it picks the first volume it finds from that list and changes Time Machine's settings to use that volume for backups.

The LaunchAgents folder contains agents:
* TimeMachineSwitcher: invoking TMSwitch on volume mount and then running backupd-helper. The TMSwitch binary needs to be in ~/bin for this to work.
* TimeMachineSleeper: turning Time Machine off at 22:30.
* TimeMachineWaker: turning Time Machine of at 8:00.
